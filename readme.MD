# Note-CLI

# Node js basics

Part of the Frontend Masters course, a CLI note app which teaches the basic concepts of node.js

## package.json

- we use bin to indicate that this is a cli app
- also #!/usr/bin/env node in index.js to let the OS know we are using node as the interpreter
- we run the following command to be able to run the cli from anywhere on the system
```
$ npm link
```
